# Digio ESign
## Digio's ESign SDK & Framework for Android and iOS Respectively have been integrated!

I have added Dummy API call methods to help you along with this replace the urls with yours

The Code Work Like Such 
\nSTEP 1 : First We will check if user has done eSIGN Or not via Doc ID exsist or not in our Shared Preferneces (You can use your Apis)

STEP 2 : We Generate a PDF Either in backend API Calls / Frontend
(The Backend Uploads PDF and Gives DOC ID here to us to do esign)

STEP 3 : The DOC ID and Phone Number Provided will go for Esign
 
STEP 4 : Native ESign SDKs/Framework of Digio will be called and Esign will be done!
